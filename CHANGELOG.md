## 2026-05-22 — Port Worker Race Condition Fix

### Fixed: Race condition causes scan to complete before port worker's nuclei tasks finish
- **File**: `workers/scanner/port_worker.py`
- Port worker queued additional `scan.nuclei` messages for discovered IPs (via `_queue_nuclei()`) and incremented `nuclei_expected` AFTER the discovery worker already finished its nuclei batches. If the discovery-based nuclei + screenshot completed first, the terminal condition `nuclei_done >= nuclei_expected && screenshot_done == 1` would trigger prematurely — scan marked "completed" while port worker hadn't even started queuing its nuclei tasks yet.
- **Impact**: Scan status showed "done" but nuclei worker was still running. Results from port-discovered IPs were orphaned.
- **Fix**: Removed `_queue_nuclei()` entirely from port worker. Discovery worker already queues nuclei for all discovered subdomains (which cover standard HTTP/HTTPS via httpx probing). Port scanning now focuses solely on port discovery and persistence. Non-standard port coverage (e.g. 8080, 8443) was never actually done by `_queue_nuclei` (it only queued `http://IP` and `https://IP`), so no coverage is lost.

### Fixed: Manual scan Redis coordinator silently fails on error
- **File**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/scans.py`
- Coordinator setup (Redis keys for `nuclei_expected`, `screenshot_done`) was wrapped in `try/except Exception: pass` — if Redis was unavailable, the keys were never created and the manual scan would hang at "running" forever with zero error feedback.
- **Fix**: Removed inner `try/except` so Redis errors propagate to the outer error handler, which marks the scan as `failed` with a descriptive message and returns HTTP 500.

## 2026-05-21 — Redis Coordinator Fix, Manual Nuclei, Pipeline Finalization

### Fixed: `register_script` is NOT async in redis-py 5.x (blocks ALL pipeline completion)
- **File**: `workers/task_coordinator.py`
- `await r.register_script()` raised `TypeError: object AsyncScript can't be used in 'await' expression`. `register_script()` is synchronous in redis-py 5.x — it returns an `AsyncScript` whose `__call__` is awaitable, but `register_script` itself is not.
- **Impact**: **Root cause of every scan stuck at "running"**. Neither nuclei nor screenshot workers could call `mark_terminal_if_all_done` — the terminal correlation message was never sent. Messages were requeued infinitely (77+ backlog in `scan.nuclei`).
- **Fix**: Remove `await` from `r.register_script()`.

### Fixed: Discovery worker never finalizes when zero downstream work queued
- **File**: `workers/scanner/discovery_worker.py`
- When discovery finds 0 assets, no nuclei/screenshot batches are published, `add_nuclei_expected` is never called, and no downstream worker exists to call `mark_terminal_if_all_done`. The scan stays "running" forever even though nothing will ever process it.
- **Fix**: Added `_finalize_if_no_work()` — sets `screenshot_done=1` and atomically calls `mark_terminal_if_all_done`, publishing the terminal correlation message if it wins the race. `_queue_downstream` now returns `nuclei_queued` boolean.

### Fixed: Nuclei worker doesn't update scan status to "running"
- **File**: `workers/scanner/nuclei_worker.py`
- Manual nuclei scans stayed stuck in "pending" because the nuclei worker never called `_update_scan_status`. Added status→running + `started_at` update at the start of `process()`.

### Fixed: Missing `UUID` import in scans endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/scans.py`
- `UUID` was used in type hints but only `import uuid` was present — no `from uuid import UUID`. Caused `NameError` on container restart.

### Added: Manual nuclei scan endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/scans.py`
- `POST /scans/manual` — accepts `org_id`, `targets` (list of URLs/domains), `vuln_depth`. Creates scan record, publishes directly to `scan.nuclei` queue, sets up Redis coordinator keys. Returns `201` with `scan_id`.

### Added: Manual scan tab in frontend ScanModal
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/modals/ScanModal.tsx`
- New "Manual Nuclei" tab alongside existing "Automated" tab. User enters targets (one per line in textarea), clicks "Run Nuclei" which calls `POST /scans/manual`.

### Fixed: Edit organization button does nothing
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/organizations/[id]/page.tsx`
- Edit button only toggled `editing` boolean but no UI was rendered. Added full edit modal with fields: name, description, domains, IP ranges, ASNs, company, industry, criticality, environment. Calls `PUT /organizations/{id}`.

## 2026-05-21 — Scanning Pipeline Overhaul: 4 Bug Fixes + Katana/FFUF + Scan Modal

### Fixed: Findings never persisted (constraint name mismatch)
- **File**: `workers/scanner/nuclei_worker.py`
- `on_conflict_do_update(constraint="uq_finding_fingerprint_org")` referenced a non-existent constraint. The `findings` table only has a regular index on `(fingerprint, org_id)`, not a named unique constraint. Every finding insert threw `UndefinedObjectError` and was dead-lettered.
- **Fix**: Changed to `index_elements=["fingerprint", "org_id"]` — uses the existing index.
- **Impact**: **Primary root cause** of zero findings in the UI.

### Fixed: Scheduler-triggered scans produced zero downstream work
- **File**: `workers/scheduler/scheduler.py`
- Config published by `_schedule_full_scans()` was missing the `modules` key → `config.get("modules", [])` returned `[]` → all stage checks failed → nothing queued.
- **Fix**: Added `"modules": ["discovery", "port", "nuclei", "screenshot"]` to full scan config.

### Fixed: Port worker column/constraint names mismatch
- **File**: `workers/scanner/port_worker.py`
- `asset_id`→`ip_id`, `port`→`port_number`, `service`→`service_name`, removed non-existent `org_id`. Constraint `uq_port_asset_port_protocol` → `index_elements`.

### Fixed: Quick scan module names incompatible with worker checks
- **File**: `workers/scheduler/scheduler.py`
- `modules: ["dns", "http", "tls"]` → `["discovery", "nuclei"]`.

### Fixed: Stale `DEFAULT_MODULES` in scan service
- **File**: `backend/app/services/scan_service.py`
- Removed dead `nikto`, `probe`, `dns`, `enrich` module names. Updated all scan types to match actual worker checks.

### Added: Tech-aware nuclei routing
- **Files**: `discovery_worker.py`, `nuclei_worker.py`
- Discovery passes `tech_map: {url: [nginx, php, ...]}` with nuclei tasks. Worker adds tech names as `-include-tags` filters. Always includes `cve` + `vulnerabilities` tags.

### Added: Katana endpoint crawling
- **File**: `discovery_worker.py` — new `_crawl_endpoints()`
- Runs `katana` against httpx-alive URLs to discover JS files, API routes, hidden paths. Results added to nuclei targets. Toggle via `config.crawl` (default: `true`).

### Added: FFUF directory/endpoint fuzzing
- **File**: `discovery_worker.py` — new `_fuzz_endpoints()`
- Optional `ffuf` fuzzing to discover `/admin/`, `/.git`, `/.env`, `/backup/`, API paths. Auto-calibrates to filter 404/redirects. Uses wordlist at `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt`, SecList, or built-in 50-entry fallback. Toggle via `config.fuzz` (default: `false`).

### Added: Frontend Scan Modal with type + toggles
- **File**: `frontend/src/components/modals/ScanModal.tsx` (new)
- Replaced one-click "Run Scan" button with a modal: scan type selector (full/quick/discovery/vuln), pipeline preview, endpoint crawling toggle (katana), directory fuzzing toggle (ffuf), advanced options. Integrated into org detail page.

### Added: Proper URL scheme routing
- **File**: `port_worker.py`
- Port worker now sends both `https://ip` and `http://ip` (not only `http://`). Discovery uses URLs with scheme from httpx results.

## 2026-05-19 — Pipeline Completion & Screenshot Fixes

### Fixed: Scan marked "completed" while nuclei still running
- **Files**: `correlation_worker.py`, `screenshot_worker.py`
- Added `is_terminal` flag. Only screenshot sends `is_terminal=True`. Correlation completes scan only on terminal messages.

### Fixed: NGINX screenshot proxy returning 404/301
- **File**: `infrastructure/nginx/nginx.conf`
- Changed `location /storage/` → `location ^~ /storage/` to force prefix matching over regex.

### Fixed: Frontend screenshot field name mismatches
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/assets/[id]/page.tsx`
- `s.created_at`/`s.taken_at` → `s.captured_at`. `s.screenshot_url` → `s.url`.

### Added: Global screenshots gallery endpoint
- **File**: `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/screenshots.py` (new)
- `GET /screenshots` with pagination, org filtering, domain search, workspace scoping.

### Fixed: Screenshots gallery page crash
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/screenshots/page.tsx`
- `new Date(undefined)` from mismatched field names crashed the page with `RangeError`.

### Fixed: crt.sh 502 errors with retry logic
- **File**: `discovery_worker.py`
- Added 3 attempts with exponential backoff and rotating User-Agent.

### Fixed: Redis counter race on scan completion
- **File**: `workers/task_coordinator.py`
- Atomic Lua script `mark_terminal_if_all_done` ensures only one worker (the last nuclei batch or screenshot) sends the terminal message.

### Fixed: RabbitMQ `ChannelInvalidStateError` on long scans
- **File**: `base_worker.py`
- Increased heartbeat to 300s. Added `ChannelInvalidStateError` handler + try/except around all ack/reject calls.

### Added: Vuln depth selection
- **Files**: `nuclei_worker.py`, `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Critical/default/full nuclei template depth configurable per scan.

### Fixed: Workers ignore `modules` list
- **File**: `discovery_worker.py`
- Vuln scans no longer run discovery. Module list gates all downstream stages.

## 2026-05-19 — Auto-Scan Toggle & Progress Bar Fix

### Added: Auto-scan enable/disable
- **Files**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`, `workspaces.py`, `scheduler.py`
- New `auto_scan_enabled` checkbox in Settings. Scheduler filters based on workspace settings.

### Fixed: Progress bar stuck at 0%
- **Files**: All workers
- Each worker now sets `progress_pct` at its stage. Changed to `func.greatest()` to prevent progress from going backwards.

### Fixed: RabbitMQ exchange bindings lost on restart
- **File**: `base_worker.py`
- Added `EXCHANGE_MAP` and auto-bind queue to exchange on every startup.

### Fixed: OpenSearch excessive RAM usage
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`, `correlation_worker.py`
- JVM heap 1GB→512MB. Index replicas set to 0 (single node).

### Added: Scan phase label in progress bar
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/scans/page.tsx`, `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Phase label: Queued → Starting → Discovery → Port → Vuln scan → Screenshots → Finalizing.

### Fixed: Empty error messages in discovery logs
- **File**: `discovery_worker.py`
- Added type+message to error logging for crtsh/assetfinder/timeout errors.

### Fixed: Nuclei worker `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'`
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- Added missing `./backend/app:/app/app:ro` volume to nuclei worker.

### Added: New Scan modal on dashboard
- **File**: `frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- Dashboard "New Scan" button now opens modal with org selector + scan type.

## 2026-05-19 — Worker Pipeline Fixes

### Fixed: `worker-port` not running
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- Port worker service was defined but never started. Pipeline stalled after discovery.

### Fixed: RabbitMQ exchange bindings missing
- **File**: `infrastructure/rabbitmq/definitions.json`
- Manually declared bindings for all exchanges. Root cause unknown (definitions.json loading issue).

### Fixed: httpx using Python CLI instead of Go binary
- **File**: `workers/Dockerfile`
- Python `httpx` pip package installed a broken CLI at `/usr/local/bin/httpx` that shadowed the ProjectDiscovery Go binary. `http_probed alive=0` despite valid subdomains.
- **Fix**: `rm -f /usr/local/bin/httpx` after pip install. Prepend `/go/bin` to PATH.

### Fixed: SQLAlchemy 2.0 `pg_insert` ORM incompatibility
- **Files**: 9 worker files
- `pg_insert(Model)` → `pg_insert(Model.__table__)` to bypass ORM bulk persistence path.

### Fixed: Go tools shadowed by Python CLI entrypoints
- **File**: `workers/Dockerfile`
- `PATH=/go/bin:...:$PATH` (prepend instead of append) to avoid future collisions.

### Fixed: Stale Python bytecache causing old constraint name error
- **File**: `workers/scanner/discovery_worker.py`
- `__pycache__` retained old constraint name. Cleared cache for clean reload.

### Changed: All worker services replicas set to 1
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- Development resource optimization. Removed `deploy.replicas` blocks.

## 2026-05-18 — API Trailing Slash Fix

### Fixed: Trailing slash mismatch on 10 root endpoints
- **Files**: 10 backend endpoint files
- `@router.get("/")` → `@router.get("")`. Frontend axios calls without trailing slash got 405.

### Added: Changelog scripts + make targets
- **Files**: `scripts/changelog.sh`, `Makefile`
- CLI helper and make targets for changelog management.

## 2026-05-17 — Frontend Build Fixes

### Fixed: Missing/nonexistent dependencies
- Removed `@radix-ui/react-badge` (never existed in npm). Downgraded `@tanstack/react-table` to 8.16.0 (CJS-compatible). Added `geist@1.3.1`.

### Fixed: Missing config files
- Created `tsconfig.json`, `postcss.config.js`, `next-env.d.ts`.

### Fixed: Broken imports in dashboard
- Removed dead component imports. Fixed `GradeRing` import path.

### Fixed: TypeScript errors
- Extracted inline const maps into typed `Record<string, ...>` variables.
